A requirement was violated in a nested call and the call was reverted as a result.
Make sure valid inputs are provided to the nested call (for instance, via passed arguments).

An assertion violation was triggered.
It is possible to trigger an assertion violation. Note that Solidity assert() statements should only be used to check invariants. Review the transaction trace generated for this issue and either make sure your program logic is correct, or use require() instead of assert() if your goal is to constrain user inputs or enforce preconditions. Remember to validate inputs from both callers (for instance, via passed arguments) and callees (for instance, via return values).

==== Dependence on predictable environment variable ====

A control flow decision is made based on The block.timestamp environment variable.
The block.timestamp environment variable is used to determine a control flow decision. Note that the values of variables like coinbase, gaslimit, block number and timestamp are predictable and can be manipulated by a malicious miner. Also keep in mind that attackers know hashes of earlier blocks. Don't use any of those environment variables as sources of randomness and be aware that use of these variables introduces a certain level of trust into miners.

==== Multiple Calls in a Single Transaction ====

Estimated Gas Usage: 14458 - 123819
Multiple calls are executed in the same transaction.
This call is executed following another call within the same transaction. It is possible that the call never gets executed if a prior call fails permanently. This might be caused intentionally by a malicious callee. If possible, refactor the code such that each transaction only executes one external call or make sure that all callees can be trusted (i.e. theyâ€™re part of your own codebase).

==== Transaction Order Dependence ====

Severity: Medium

Function name: play()
PC address: 863
Estimated Gas Usage: 14458 - 123819
The value of the call is dependent on balance or storage write
This can lead to race conditions. An attacker may be able to run a transaction after our transaction which can change the value of the call
